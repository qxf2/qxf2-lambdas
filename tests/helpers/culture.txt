<b>Rough starts are normal at Qxf2</b> If you are feeling not-good-enough, remind yourself that most employees have rough starts at Qxf2. After all, you are transitioning into a very different way of working that requires you to change, learn and unlearn many things. You should also know that it gets better over time and sometimes even fun(!) when you get used to our system of working.
<b>How to succeed in your first few weeks with Qxf2</b> The traits that will let you successfully navigate the initial phase with Qxf2 do not require talent. Key traits among the successful Qxf2 employees were: >a) showing up daily (well, virtually)>b) being open about their difficulties at work  >c) being willing to change their habits.

<b>How to succeed in your first few weeks with Qxf2</b> The traits that will let you successfully navigate the initial phase with Qxf2 do not require talent. Key traits among the successful Qxf2 employees were: >a) showing up daily (well, virtually)>b) being open about their difficulties at work  >c) being willing to change their habits.  So, keep trying every day, be open about your difficulties and be willing to change.
<b>How are you judging me?</b> We will not judge you based on your knowledge or achievements at this stage of your relationship with Qxf2. Why? Because you are transitioning from one system of work into another. That means you need to unlearn, learn and piece together multiple habits before you are productive. Instead, we are judging you based on your effort, the openness that you show in asking for help and your ability to adapt. Do that and you will find things will work out over well the coming months.
<b>Its not only you</b> New hires think they are the only ones struggling to get a handle on their work while everyone else has figured it out. Not really. The rest of us look comfortable only because we have made peace with high levels of ambiguity and complexity. At some point, you are going to realize that each of us are on our own journey of learning, unlearning, doing and failing.
<b>Failure despite effort</b> Qxf2 is a stressful environment until you learn multiple new habits and the compounding effect of those habits kick in. Until then, you are going to repeatedly fail despite trying hard. We know failing repeatedly over a long enough period of time is highly stressful for professionals. We have taken several steps to make failure-despite-effort less stressful. For example, we have tried to make failing-despite-effort as non-punitive as possible. We are also very receptive to hearing about your failures. So feel safe to try your best and come up short.
<b>Adaptive vs Technical challenges</b> Technical challenges are solved by knowledge and training. But there are some challenges that evolve as you solve them. These are adaptive challenges. Parenting is probably is the most relatable example of an adaptive challenge. Adaptive challenges not only need technical skills but they also need constant engagement, fresh mindsets and ever-improving mental models. As you continue your journey through Qxf2, remember this critical distinction. It is not enough that you just execute the tasks given to you. You need to periodically introspect and evaluate if the work is changing your habits, mindset and perspective.
<b>A tip for your first year</b> I have a simple tip to make your first year at Qxf2 so much easier. Stop asking what-is-the-use-of-doing-X? and just do X. Its ok if nobody else you know outside of Qxf2 is doing X. Over time, you will notice that doing X had multiple benefits that neither you nor me could have predicted (called emergent-behavior in a complex system) and you will be better off for having tried.
<b>We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us. - Winston Churchill</b> Early employees are expected to actively contribute to company design. I usually describe this task as help-me-build-the-company during interviews. Understandably, for most people, this is a little too vague. But as early employees, hopefully, you are starting to realize a company and its culture gets built over time - either consciously or by default. I find this topic fascinating and I suspect if you spent some time Googling about it, you would too!
<b>Bad beginnings</b> Our schooling did a great job of instilling values of hard work, discipline, logical thinking and holding ourselves to high standards. I wish they had taken the time to explain that those characteristics are good in most contexts but not all! A specific context where most of those supposed strengths fail is when you attempt to do something new. You can get over this bias though. The next time you start something new, remind yourself that it is natural to struggle and be clueless when doing new things.
<b>There is no happily every after</b> As you progress within Qxf2, hopefully, you are adding new techniques and capabilities to your testing toolbelt. If you have worked elsewhere before, you might even start wondering what the happily-ever-after scenario will look like. While this may seem like a good question, make peace with leaving it unanswered. I feel like the question comes from societal conditioning. We have always been told that if we work hard during insert-critical-life-phase-here, things will become easy after that. Instead of adopting this (imo) poor mental model, just view learning as a side-effect of solving problems and do not really worry about where all this is going to culminate.
<b>What is a good failure?</b> As of Jun 2020, I think a good failure has four components. One, the person/people working made a sincere effort to do what they can and then looked foolish or incompetent. Two, the failure leads to situational insights, mindset improvements and technical improvements. Three, the failure exposes more than one problem within Qxf2 ... not just improvements of the individual(s) involved. Four, there is an appetite to right the failure.
<b>Mixed bag is not the same as mediocre</b> A mixed bag has high-highs and low-lows. Mediocre performance is when you are average all through - you neither impress nor annoy. When I say it is ok to fail at clients, I am implicitly assuming there are already some things you do well. If you fail at a specific task because you chose something new, it will be ok because nobody is expected to be good at everything. A mixed bag of performance has a tremendous upside for Qxf2 and your own career.
<b>One of the great challenges of the game is how to make progress when there are no obvious moves, when action is required not reaction. - Gary Kasparov</b> This is true not only in chess but in our careers as well. When things are going smooth, we seem to want to coast. Its ok to coast for a while, especially after a hectic release. But over the long term, make sure your are exploring new problems regularly.
<b>Your technical powers and test ideas are supposed co-evolve</b> Your QA output should not be your previous job output plus one or two new tools. We are not trying to do your old job in an automated way. Instead, technical skills should expand the scope of what a QA engineer can do. All the technical skill and tooling you pick up is supposed to help you probe the software being tested in a more effective way. As you become more technical, you should be able to conduct tests that you previously could not even imagine. You should be able to understand the nuances of implementations and vary your tests accordingly. If you have been here for a couple of years and your testing outlook has not evolved beyond <i>manual + automation</i>, please talk to you 1:1 manager and/or experienced colleagues.
<b>We test early-stage products</b> This is different from testing mature products with an established user base. A big difference happens to be that speed is critical to an early-stage product.  Early-stage products are still discovering their user base and the kind of solution that scales. They need to run several experiments and iterate many times before they land upon a solution that will work. The quicker they can run these experiments, the better their odds of survival are. So when you test early-stage products, think of how you can improve their speed to market.
<b>Be resourceful at a client</b> We work with early-stage products and small engineering teams. More warm bodies and process heavy methodologies and more meetings are very rarely the answer. You cannot expect thorough documentation or access to a business analyst or product manager who has loads of time to spend with you. Everyone is busy and tasked with more work than they can handle. Instead of retreating into a shell and waiting for your client to unblock you, you need to be observant and resourceful. Think on your own and try things out. If needed, ask on the Qxf2 channel for help.
<b>When you do not understand something in a conversation ...</b> ... do NOT get into the habit of thinking that you will learn about the topic when you have time and then speak up in the coming days. Instead, first try to pay attention even if you seem lost. Second, in most cases, clarify or admit you do not understand on the call. Especially if the task is going to fall to you. Third, make it a daily habit to expose yourself to new things.
<b>How to start at a brand new client</b> You are expected to follow this approach https://qxf2.com/where-start-testing if you are new to Qxf2. The outline in that document will help you understand the product you are testing better while also letting you make decisions on how to proceed with testing. The document there is not some checkbox that you do as an exercise once within Qxf2 and then forget when you land at a client. If you are new to Qxf2, please make sure you are following that methodology. If you have worked at Qxf2 for a while, please ensure new people follow the approach at clients.
<b>Generalize your learning</b> A great way to keep up with ever-changing technologies is to generalize your learning. Generalizing lets you abstract many things into one concept. It helps you associate new tools with existing ones and brings down your cognitive load. For example, if I learnt to configure a Jenkins job, I would generalize my learning as follows. Jenkins solves the problem of a gigantic code merge by letting people continually integrate their code to the codebase in small increments. It does this by removing the need of having a human do a build-test-merge. Instead, it provided a web interface to write and execute shell commands before and after a build. If you can get to that level of abstraction, any new CI tool can be tackled easily. You simply have to figure out what interface the new tool provides and how to describe your build-test-merge steps in that tool.
<b>Please work on communicating your testing better</b> Start with the summary. Then explain <i>what</i> you tested but also <i>how</i> you tested. If needed, use screenshots and tables and bulleted lists. And finally, focus on your English too! Language matters. I see (me especially!) us use English poorly. We often use pronouns (this, that, it, etc.) when we should be using better words to describe what we want to express. Please make an attempt to improve. When you catch yourself using words like this/that/it/those, etc., substitute such determiners/pronouns with whatever actual thing you want. Example: <i>I clicked that button and it did not work</i> vs <i>I clicked the compose button but the email composer window did not show up</i>
<b>Technical QA != Automation</b> Please do not equate writing automation to being technical. Technical QA involves being able to understand systems and design tradeoffs, adhere to good engineering principles, perform complex setup operations, create tools to enable other QA and much more. I want us to be technical QA. That is very different from wanting folks who can write automated tests.
<b>Too much of a good thing ...</b> Please do not overdo good things like working extra hours or working weekends to help us succeed or skipping your allotted PTO. The reason I do not want too much of such behavior is because it tends to mask deeper organizational problems like poor planning, understaffing, exploitative bosses, etc. You might occasionally need to do stuff like stretching your work hours, replying to messages in your off-hours or working on weekends. That is ok. But when you do, please call it out explicitly on a public channel.
<b>Companies do not go obsolete ... employees do.</b> ITeS companies in India have the reputation of doing outdated work. The media and our peers tend to talk of them as going obsolete. I have news for you. Every major Indian ITeS provider has been around for more than three decades. They evolved and remained relevant from the pre-Internet era to today. But most employees who did very well for these companies ended up becoming obsolete with every new wave of technology. This happened because they passively executed what their client or boss wanted. Do not make the same mistake. Make sure you are choosing tasks that simultaneously benefit your client, Qxf2 and <i>you</i>.
<b>Process should not precede understanding</b> We should not be putting processes before most of the company understands the nuances and complexities of a problem. Process preceding understanding is one of the major reasons that people at large companies struggle to fit into smaller companies like ours. For too long, they could blindly follow the process without having to understand the intricacies of the problem that the process was solving. That, in turn, meant that they never got a realistic picture of how software is made and instead developed a distorted concept that there was a <i>correct way</i> of working. Let us delay becoming like that for as long as we can. BTW, it is ok to propose a process to a problem that we have a high degree of common understanding within Qxf2.
<b>The difficulty in teaching people how to test</b> I have been grappling with one problem for many years now - <i>are there better ways to teach people how to test</i>? Every time I tackle this problem, I run into the brick wall of testing involving a lot of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is intuitive, experience-based knowledge. Skills that involve a lot of tacit knowledge are difficult to describe in words but easy to show. Dancing is a good example. A beginner can learn much more about dancing by seeing someone else dance rather than writing books about dancing. Testing has a similar problem. It is incredibly hard to communicate what we do to the uninitiated. Can you think of interesting ways we can show new testers what we do?
<b>Getting off autopilot is exhausting but essential</b> If you are new at Qxf2, please make an effort to get off autopilot. Try to think actively throughout the day. This tiring and requires a lot more energy on your part. It is especially hard because you were really good at your previous job. So good that you were able to go on autopilot for the most part. One of the reasons the first several weeks at Qxf2 is challenging is that you are (hopefully!) not given a chance to be on autopilot. For folks who have been here a while, please sure any onboarding/training material you design forces the new person to get off autopilot. Do not give new hires a chance to fall back to their old ways. Design material that looks very different from every other tutorial on the web.\nPS: This is not an original insight. I came across it when reading literature about learning.
<b>Unconscious competence</b> I do not like the habit of keeping a long list of commands/instructions/procedures that you can then copy-paste or blindly follow. Keeping notes that you copy-paste from does not engage your brain sufficiently. This habit also prevents you from achieving a key stage in learning that people call <i>unconscious competence</i>. If you keep a file with a bunch of commands that have worked for you in the past and then copy-pasting commands/instructions/procedures, please try to limit this habit. Make an attempt to understand what is going on and that will help you commit the steps to memory.
<b>What have you unlearnt?</b> Please think about the work habits you have unlearnt after joining Qxf2. It is not sufficient to simply learn the material presented or do the tasks allotted. A key component to succeeding as a Qxf2 employee is unlearning. There are long-standing habits that you need to actively unlearn. For example, asking technical questions in writing on a common channel requires you to unlearn your old habit of calling a colleague and saying <i>This is not working. Help me.</i> This exercise of consciously evaluating what to unlearn is especially important to new hires. Please do not skip this exercise.
<b>Low drama environment</b> Hopefully, Qxf2 comes across as a place with very little drama. We do not celebrate wildly when things go our way. We do not become depressed when things do not go our way. You will rarely see us heroically pulling all-nighters and racing towards a deadline. You will rarely see us sitting idly when the workload wanes. I would like to keep Qxf2 this way. This is because I value being steady, consistent and even. I know this sort of environment is not for everyone. If you are from a different environment, try and give this approach a shot for at least 6 months. If you still end up missing periodic adrenaline rushes at work, may be we are not the right environment for you.
<b>Symmetric behavior</b> Symmetry in behavior can, to an extent, help us build a fair environment. For example, I am ok if someone openly yells at a colleague for a mistake. But I expect symmetry in behavior. The yeller should have been equally loud/emphatic when their colleagues do good work. I also expect the yeller to be equally emotional/vocal about their own mistakes. In general, this sort of symmetry is hard for aggressive people to practice. An easier path to achieve symmetric behavior is to be kind/measured with your colleagues. \nBTW, did you know we can (to some extent) probe for symmetry during interviews? Ask a question in Round 1. Then, in round 2, ask the reverse question. For example, if in Round 1, the candidate tells you that their pet peeve is poor communication. In Round 2, ask them to give you an example where they communicated poorly and see what they say.
<b>Heroism masks problems</b> Please let projects fail for the right reasons. The very first time you notice something wrong, it might be ok to be a hero as long as you bring it my attention. But after that, do not be a hero too often. Do not pull all-nighters often. Do not take on more than your fair share of responsibility over long periods of time (>6 months). Yeah, occasionally you will have to stretch but if you are stretching more than say twice a quarter, you are masking problems within Qxf2. The most common reasons for needing heroic behavior at work are poor hiring decisions, poor management, poor team dynamics, poor tooling, poor processes and understaffing. If something at Qxf2 is crap, it should be exposed. If not, we might scale thinking all is good. And when we scale crap, we end up with a ton of crap.
<b>It is normal to hate your job once in a while</b> It is ok to hate your job sometimes. In fact, if you hate your job once in a while, it means you are probably growing. I have hated my job at Qxf2 a few times in the past. I even hated playing chess on some days when I was still competing. This is normal. You do not have to feel guilty about it. If you are disliking your job for several weeks together, please talk to your 1:1 manager. They will try to help you decide on what to change. Almost always, changing the nature of work will not be the answer. Instead, it will probably be changing mindset and/or your outlook that helps.
<b>Find your baseline</b> Many professionals have made no attempt at figuring out how different setups, work sequences, constraints, and distractions influence their work output. Treat this as a testing problem. Experiment. Vary different portions of your work and see what suits you. The productivity gains will be good but that is a secondary concern. The primary benefit I got by doing this exercise was to recognize the many, many invisible factors that influence work.
<b>Honest retrospectives</b> Please make an effort to fill out your retrospective well. Good, honest, open and thoughtful retrospectives serve as a culture reinforcement tool. Good retrospectives help normalize the fact that all of us are struggling and doing good at the same time. This will help the new hire identify with us quicker. Open retrospectives remove the stigma around failure. The more honestly we share our experience, the more likely that the new folks will trust us. The more thoughtful our retrospectives, the more likely that our new hires will be more introspective.
<b>Everyone has the authority to give feedback</b> Please be observant for bad (or inefficient) habits in your colleagues. When you notice something wrong or sub-optimal with the behaviour of a colleague - speak up! You <i>do not</i> have to be their boss to speak up. As an early employee, it is in your interest to get into the habit of giving feedback. Some simple guidelines around giving feedback - give feedback to your colleagues as early as possible instead of waiting for an ideal moment. Try your best not to be too accusatory during the feedback. Asking a thought-provoking question or pointing a missing piece are also valid forms of feedback. If your feedback is received (or given) poorly, rest assured that there are several other actors in the system that will try to correct the situation. Related internal discussion: https://trello.com/c/frjiaRtk/42-group-discussion-how-to-get-better-at-giving-feedback
<b>Micro-learning</b> I am a big fan of micro-learning or the learning that happens in really small chunks but in a regular manner. Shiva-s approach to <b>Python Question of the Day</b> is a good example of micro-learning. But you do not need anyone bright to guide your micro-learning. You can do that daily by simply asking yourself better questions as you go about your day. Just being curious about how something works or following up on a new word or an attempt to avoid a usual step or re-ordering your routine can keep your work fresh and while helping you learn something new.
<b>Consuming and producing</b> Please make sure you are producing work that helps other and not just consuming stuff all the time. That is the responsible way. Every smart colleague I have ever had has been a producer, a giver, a sharer. If you are using StackOverflow every day to make you look good at your job, please make time to answer a few questions there too. If you are reading blog posts to help you at your job, it is your responsibility to write what you know too. It is extremely easy for you to just take, take and take - and then give the excuse that you are too busy to share. But remember that the people that you took from also have lives and busy professional lives.
<b>A different starting point to testing</b> A lot of what we talk about within Qxf2 might seem very different to what you were used to in your previous job. But over time, you will come to appreciate how much of what we do overlaps with what you already did. The reason you might feel a little dis-oriented at the start is because we tend to use different starting points to solve problems. For example, you might be used to testing applications only using the UI and by only having one testing environment. Over here, we have developed techniques and learnt tools that lets us start testing at different places. The principles of testing remain similar - all that differs is the starting point.
<b>Autonomy and responsibility</b> For a complex system to work in a fair way, freedom and responsibility need to remain proportional. Apathy produces a concentration of power. Low engagement leads to forced tasks. Frequent unforced errors leads to stifling structures. Early employees should really, really think about this. Many of you have spent a significant time (years!) helping me build Qxf2. If you do not want that effort to go waste, please make sure that you are holding the new folks accountable to high standards of responsibility.
<b>Getting better without increasing knowledge</b> Most people think the only way to become better at their jobs is by learning some new tools or techniques that they can add to their resume. This approach is valid as long as you have a lot of time on your hands. After that, working on your thinking is going to have a far larger impact on getting better. Your ability to generalize, abstract, relate, chunk, synthesize and combine are going to help you stay relevant and competitive. So do yourself a favour and start thinking about how you think. Observe how other think in similar situations. If you need to Google for this stuff, try searching for <i>meta-cognition</i> or <i>conceptual understanding</i>.
<b>You are responsible for your career</b> The person most responsible for your career is you. You manager is <i>also</i> responsible for your career. Your employer is <i>also</i> responsible for your career. But at the end of the day, they do not suffer if your career goes south. So when you pick tasks, try to get better. If you are handed tasks, modify your approach just enough to learn new things. If you are repeatedly working on the same thing, try it with a different toolbelt or a different process or a different mindset. If you are having trouble shaking yourself out of a rut, speak to your 1:1 manager.
<b>Varying your work habits</b> If you feel your current work has little scope for learning, think again. Learning is not just about increasing your knowledge base. There are many other ways to vary your work and improve without actually changing your tasking. For example, you could try to increase the intensity or pace at which you do the same work. You could try to add something extra to what you already deliver. Or you could try removing a sub-task and see if your work still gets done. Perhaps you can try communicating the work you do in a different manner? Maybe reorder the sub-tasks to be a bit more creative. Alternatively, you might want to increase the quality with which you previously did something. Try some of the suggestions here and see which ones help you improve.
<b>Increase your exposure</b> I have noticed that our group discussions are producing one point repeatedly. We would all benefit if we knew more :). You are going to be extremely slow if you rely on experience or classes to learn new things. You need some other way to get more exposure. My method is to read what others have to say. But reading is not for everyone. So find your own method. Maybe it is podcasts. Or videos. Perhaps it is open source contributions. Or gabbing with your ex-colleagues. Whatever it is, make sure you are exposing yourself to what is happening in other small companies and what is happening in the testing world.
<b>The Normalization of Deviance</b>Sociology describes 'normalization of deviance' as the phenomenon of slow cultural drift. What used to be not-okay slowly gets classified as okay. I find this interesting because I think it accurately describes what early employees go through. Early employees usually fail to speak up when they notice deviations from newer folk just to be nice. Over time, these small omissions end up moving the culture of the company pretty drastically. If you see such deviations, please speak up. Every single one of you has the right and the responsibility to point out such deviations. Maintaining the parts of our culture that you like is going to take effort!
<b>Tangential skills</b>If you find the time today, try learning about one of these topics by watching a 10-minute YouTube video: typography, choosing colors, how to make good slides, using whitespace in design, producing sketch notes, advanced Google search hacks, GMail tips, how to type faster, how to draw good graphs. If you feel like learning about more than one, resist the urge. This message will show up again pretty soon.
<b>Easing into reading</b> For today, pick some book you always wanted to read and look up its summary on YouTube. Do not watch videos longer than 15-minutes. If you feel comfortable, share the video you watched on the etc, etc, etc channel.
<b>Look for tech everywhere</b> An easy way to be creative is to combine ideas from different worlds. For today, YouTube search <i>tech used in ______</i> where _____ is anything you like in life. Do not watch videos longer than 15-minutes. If you feel comfortable, share the video you found on the etc, etc, etc channel.every day, be open about your difficulties and be willing to change.
<b>How are you judging me?</b> We will not judge you based on your knowledge or achievements at this stage of your relationship with Qxf2. Why? Because you are transitioning from one system of work into another. That means you need to unlearn, learn and piece together multiple habits before you are productive. Instead, we are judging you based on your effort, the openness that you show in asking for help and your ability to adapt. Do that and you will find things will work out over well the coming months.
<b>Its not only you</b> New hires think they are the only ones struggling to get a handle on their work while everyone else has figured it out. Not really. The rest of us look comfortable only because we have made peace with high levels of ambiguity and complexity. At some point, you are going to realize that each of us are on our own journey of learning, unlearning, doing and failing.

Instead, first try to pay attention even if you seem lost. Second, in most cases, clarify or admit you do not understand on the call. Especially if the task is going to fall to you. Third, make it a daily habit to expose yourself to new things.
<b>How to start at a brand new client</b> You are expected to follow this approach https://qxf2.com/where-start-testing if you are new to Qxf2. The outline in that document will help you understand the product you are testing better while also letting you make decisions on how to proceed with testing. The document there is not some checkbox that you do as an exercise once within Qxf2 and then forget when you land at a client. If you are new to Qxf2, please make sure you are following that methodology. If you have worked at Qxf2 for a while, please ensure new people follow the approach at clients.
<b>Generalize your learning</b> A great way to keep up with ever-changing technologies is to generalize your learning. Generalizing lets you abstract many things into one concept. It helps you associate new tools with existing ones and brings down your cognitive load. For example, if I learnt to configure a Jenkins job, I would generalize my learning as follows. Jenkins solves the problem of a gigantic code merge by letting people continually integrate their code to the codebase in small increments. It does this by removing the need of having a human do a build-test-merge. Instead, it provided a web interface to write and execute shell commands before and after a build. If you can get to that level of abstraction, any new CI tool can be tackled easily. You simply have to figure out what interface the new tool provides and how to describe your build-test-merge steps in that tool.
<b>Please work on communicating your testing better</b> Start with the summary. Then explain <i>what</i> you tested but also <i>how</i> you tested. If needed, use screenshots and tables and bulleted lists. And finally, focus on your English too! Language matters. I see (me especially!) us use English poorly. We often use pronouns (this, that, it, etc.) when we should be using better words to describe what we want to express. Please make an attempt to improve. When you catch yourself using words like this/that/it/those, etc., substitute such determiners/pronouns with whatever actual thing you want. Example: <i>I clicked that button and it did not work</i> vs <i>I clicked the compose button but the email composer window did not show up</i>
<b>Technical QA != Automation</b> Please do not equate writing automation to being technical. Technical QA involves being able to understand systems and design tradeoffs, adhere to good engineering principles, perform complex setup operations, create tools to enable other QA and much more. I want us to be technical QA. That is very different from wanting folks who can write automated tests.
<b>Too much of a good thing ...</b> Please do not overdo good things like working extra hours or working weekends to help us succeed or skipping your allotted PTO. The reason I do not want too much of such behavior is because it tends to mask deeper organizational problems like poor planning, understaffing, exploitative bosses, etc. You might occasionally need to do stuff like stretching your work hours, replying to messages in your off-hours or working on weekends. That is ok. But when you do, please call it out explicitly on a public channel.
<b>Companies do not go obsolete ... employees do.</b> ITeS companies in India have the reputation of doing outdated work. The media and our peers tend to talk of them as going obsolete. I have news for you. Every major Indian ITeS provider has been around for more than three decades. They evolved and remained relevant from the pre-Internet era to today. But most employees who did very well for these companies ended up becoming obsolete with every new wave of technology. This happened because they passively executed what their client or boss wanted. Do not make the same mistake. Make sure you are choosing tasks that simultaneously benefit your client, Qxf2 and <i>you</i>.
<b>Process should not precede understanding</b> We should not be putting processes before most of the company understands the nuances and complexities of a problem. Process preceding understanding is one of the major reasons that people at large companies struggle to fit into smaller companies like ours. For too long, they could blindly follow the process without having to understand the intricacies of the problem that the process was solving. That, in turn, meant that they never got a realistic picture of how software is made and instead developed a distorted concept that there was a <i>correct way</i> of working. Let us delay becoming like that for as long as we can. BTW, it is ok to propose a process to a problem that we have a high degree of common understanding within Qxf2.
<b>The difficulty in teaching people how to test</b> I have been grappling with one problem for many years now - <i>are there better ways to teach people how to test</i>? Every time I tackle this problem, I run into the brick wall of testing involving a lot of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is intuitive, experience-based knowledge. Skills that involve a lot of tacit knowledge are difficult to describe in words but easy to show. Dancing is a good example. A beginner can learn much more about dancing by seeing someone else dance rather than writing books about dancing. Testing has a similar problem. It is incredibly hard to communicate what we do to the uninitiated. Can you think of interesting ways we can show new testers what we do?
<b>Getting off autopilot is exhausting but essential</b> If you are new at Qxf2, please make an effort to get off autopilot. Try to think actively throughout the day. This tiring and requires a lot more energy on your part. It is especially hard because you were really good at your previous job. So good that you were able to go on autopilot for the most part. One of the reasons the first several weeks at Qxf2 is challenging is that you are (hopefully!) not given a chance to be on autopilot. For folks who have been here a while, please sure any onboarding/training material you design forces the new person to get off autopilot. Do not give new hires a chance to fall back to their old ways. Design material that looks very different from every other tutorial on the web.\nPS: This is not an original insight. I came across it when reading literature about learning.
<b>Unconscious competence</b> I do not like the habit of keeping a long list of commands/instructions/procedures that you can then copy-paste or blindly follow. Keeping notes that you copy-paste from does not engage your brain sufficiently. This habit also prevents you from achieving a key stage in learning that people call <i>unconscious competence</i>. If you keep a file with a bunch of commands that have worked for you in the past and then copy-pasting commands/instructions/procedures, please try to limit this habit. Make an attempt to understand what is going on and that will help you commit the steps to memory.
<b>What have you unlearnt?</b> Please think about the work habits you have unlearnt after joining Qxf2. It is not sufficient to simply learn the material presented or do the tasks allotted. A key component to succeeding as a Qxf2 employee is unlearning. There are long-standing habits that you need to actively unlearn. For example, asking technical questions in writing on a common channel requires you to unlearn your old habit of calling a colleague and saying <i>This is not working. Help me.</i> This exercise of consciously evaluating what to unlearn is especially important to new hires. Please do not skip this exercise.
<b>Low drama environment</b> Hopefully, Qxf2 comes across as a place with very little drama. We do not celebrate wildly when things go our way. We do not become depressed when things do not go our way. You will rarely see us heroically pulling all-nighters and racing towards a deadline. You will rarely see us sitting idly when the workload wanes. I would like to keep Qxf2 this way. This is because I value being steady, consistent and even. I know this sort of environment is not for everyone. If you are from a different environment, try and give this approach a shot for at least 6 months. If you still end up missing periodic adrenaline rushes at work, may be we are not the right environment for you.
<b>Symmetric behavior</b> Symmetry in behavior can, to an extent, help us build a fair environment. For example, I am ok if someone openly yells at a colleague for a mistake. But I expect symmetry in behavior. The yeller should have been equally loud/emphatic when their colleagues do good work. I also expect the yeller to be equally emotional/vocal about their own mistakes. In general, this sort of symmetry is hard for aggressive people to practice. An easier path to achieve symmetric behavior is to be kind/measured with your colleagues. \nBTW, did you know we can (to some extent) probe for symmetry during interviews? Ask a question in Round 1. Then, in round 2, ask the reverse question. For example, if in Round 1, the candidate tells you that their pet peeve is poor communication. In Round 2, ask them to give you an example where they communicated poorly and see what they say.
<b>Heroism masks problems</b> Please let projects fail for the right reasons. The very first time you notice something wrong, it might be ok to be a hero as long as you bring it my attention. But after that, do not be a hero too often. Do not pull all-nighters often. Do not take on more than your fair share of responsibility over long periods of time (>6 months). Yeah, occasionally you will have to stretch but if you are stretching more than say twice a quarter, you are masking problems within Qxf2. The most common reasons for needing heroic behavior at work are poor hiring decisions, poor management, poor team dynamics, poor tooling, poor processes and understaffing. If something at Qxf2 is crap, it should be exposed. If not, we might scale thinking all is good. And when we scale crap, we end up with a ton of crap.
<b>It is normal to hate your job once in a while</b> It is ok to hate your job sometimes. In fact, if you hate your job once in a while, it means you are probably growing. I have hated my job at Qxf2 a few times in the past. I even hated playing chess on some days when I was still competing. This is normal. You do not have to feel guilty about it. If you are disliking your job for several weeks together, please talk to your 1:1 manager. They will try to help you decide on what to change. Almost always, changing the nature of work will not be the answer. Instead, it will probably be changing mindset and/or your outlook that helps.
<b>Find your baseline</b> Many professionals have made no attempt at figuring out how different setups, work sequences, constraints, and distractions influence their work output. Treat this as a testing problem. Experiment. Vary different portions of your work and see what suits you. The productivity gains will be good but that is a secondary concern. The primary benefit I got by doing this exercise was to recognize the many, many invisible factors that influence work.
<b>Honest retrospectives</b> Please make an effort to fill out your retrospective well. Good, honest, open and thoughtful retrospectives serve as a culture reinforcement tool. Good retrospectives help normalize the fact that all of us are struggling and doing good at the same time. This will help the new hire identify with us quicker. Open retrospectives remove the stigma around failure. The more honestly we share our experience, the more likely that the new folks will trust us. The more thoughtful our retrospectives, the more likely that our new hires will be more introspective.
