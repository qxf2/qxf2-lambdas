## A collection of lambdas used at Qxf2

AWS lambda function used by Qxf2 will live in this repo. Each lambda will have it's own directory. Optionally, each lambda might have one GitHub Action related to it's deploy. 

### Context 
We are really not sure how to distribute code among repos when maintaining a microservices style of architecture. We use a few AWS lambda functions within Qxf2. As of Juy 2020, they were in the repos that needed them. We moved all the lambdas into one repo to try out how this style of distributing code would work out for us.
